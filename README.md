## About me:
 Systems Analysis and Development student at SENAC-SP.    
 
 I am currently developing skills in creating RESTful APIs, cloud computing concepts using AWS, Docker, developing and implementing unit tests using JUnit5 and Mockito. I'm looking for my first opportunity in the technology field, either in I.T. support or software development.

 ### Last projects I worked on:

 1. **Soccer Carrer Java**
   - Role-playing game designed to simulate the career of a professional soccer player, where performance is measured through multiple-choice questions and each
   stage has a minimum score to advance.
   - Technology used: Java.

 2. **Street Clothing**
   - Point-of-sale system for clothing and accessories, with graphical interfaces using javax.swing to create sales menus, customer and product registers and sales reports, with            integration to the MySQL database for CRUD of products, customers and orders.
   - Technologies used: Java | Maven | SQL | MySQL.


 3. **Pizzeria REST API**
   - RESTful API developed to manage a pizzeria, allowing basic operations such as creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) customers, products and orders. Following good            practices in API development, such as implementing service classes to separate the business logic from the request handlers, using the correct HTTP verbs and appropriate responses       for each scenario. Implementation of HATEOAS in the responses with directional links to help the API user and documentation with Swagger UI, which allows better visualization and        testing of the application's enpoints.
   - Migrations implemented using Flyway to version the application schema and control changes to the database.
   - Technologies used: Java | Maven | SpringBoot | MySQL | JPA | Hibernate | Flyway | HATEOAS | Swagger.

   Thank you for visiting my repository and I hope you find something interesting here. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions.

   **Let's build something amazing together!** ðŸš€
